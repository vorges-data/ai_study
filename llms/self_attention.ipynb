    "## Simplified Example of Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a simplified example of how the **self-attention** mechanism works using a basic sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the sentence “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” as an example.\n",
    "- Simple random embeddings are generated for each word.\n",
    "- A simplified version of the self-attention mechanism is implemented.\n",
    "- We analyze how each word relates to the others in the sentence based on attention weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `make_word_embedding` function generates random vectors to represent words.\n",
    "- In real models, these embeddings are learned during training and capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Softmax Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts attention scores into probabilities, allowing the model to assign different levels of importance to each word in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplified Self-Attention**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `self_attention` function simulates the self-attention process:\n",
    "  - Creates Q (query), K (key), and V (value) matrices from the same word embeddings.\n",
    "  - Computes attention scores by taking the dot product between Q and K.\n",
    "  - Applies softmax to the scores to obtain attention weights.\n",
    "  - Computes weighted values by multiplying attention weights with the V matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sentence is split into words.\n",
    "2. Each word is transformed into a random embedding vector.\n",
    "3. The self-attention function is applied to compute how each word \"attends\" to the others.\n",
    "4. The output displays attention weights and which word received the most attention from each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code prints the attention weight matrix between each pair of words.\n",
    "- It also provides a simple interpretation of which word receives the most attention from each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a highly simplified, illustrative example for educational purposes.\n",
    "- In real Transformer models, the attention mechanism is more complex, including:\n",
    "  - Separate linear projections for Q, K, and V.\n",
    "  - Scaling of attention scores.\n",
    "  - Multi-head attention.\n",
    "  - Additional layers and learned parameters during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this example helps visualize how context is considered in natural language processing through self-attention.\n"

    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- These examples are **simplified** for educational purposes.\n",
    "- In real-world models (e.g., Transformers):\n",
    "  - Q, K, and V are derived through separate learned linear projections.\n",
    "  - Attention is computed across multiple **heads** and **layers**.\n",
    "  - Embeddings are pre-trained and semantically rich.\n",
    "  - Attention is often scaled and masked depending on the task (e.g., causal masking for language generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "These two examples demonstrate how the self-attention mechanism adapts to sentences of different lengths and complexities. While the underlying logic remains the same, longer or more semantically rich sentences require better visualization strategies (like limiting output) to make interpretation easier. This reflects a core strength of attention mechanisms: flexibility in handling variable-length input and contextual relevance.\n"
